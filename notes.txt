## Phase 2 Trails

"Does Drug X improve Disease Y?"
  "What quantity of Drug X works better on Disease Y, (1 mg, 2 mg or 3 mg)?" and 
  "Does Drug X work better on Disease Y taken once or twice a day?"

Phase 2a: These trials involve fewer patients, typically 100 to 300, and focus on 
    -   **dose-response relationships**: How increasing dosage increments correlates to increase in response, and
    -   **optimal dosing frequency**: The ideal schedule for administering a treatment to achieve the best results while minimizing side effects.
