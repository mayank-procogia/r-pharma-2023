    "text": "Phase 2 Trails\n\nA Phase 2 trial answers the question, “Does Drug X improve Disease Y?”\n\n\n\nPhase 2 clinical trials assess the safety and efficacy of a new drug or drug combination for a specific medical condition.\nGoal: Determine appropriate dose and treatment plan for Phase 3 testing.\nPhase 2a: Involves fewer patients, generally 100-300 patients to focus on dose-response relationships and optimal dosing frequency.\nPhase 2b: Rigorously assesses drug’s effectiveness in disease treatment, prevention, or diagnosis.\nAssess therapeutic effectiveness in a specific patient group for potential Phase 3 study.\nAlso used to assess and review safety parameters for potential adverse events that might have been missed in a particular patient group."
