![](data/logo_migration.png){.absolute bottom="6rem" right="0" height="250"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Engage with the Bio Stats Team

-   Weekly connects with Bio Stats to ensure that the MVP build is on the right track.
-   Adopt **Agile methodology** for faster iterative improvement and development.
-   Actively listen to user (Bio Stats) feedback and take "notes".
    -   Prioritize features based on complexity, time, effort and need.
    -   Pro-actively research and pick up features from the end of the task list in free time to keep developers engaged and happy.
-   Utilize GitHub Issues to document feature requests or bug fixes.
    -   A picture speaks a thousand words. If it can be explained with a **screenshot**, don't shy away.
-   Ensure commits are linked with respective issues for traceability during testing.
-   Establish clear requirements to expedite implementation, with developer input on the overall app workflow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Principles of Application Design

-   Think about creating and showcasing dashboard outlines in the early discussions.
    -   Prototype the UI layout using [draw.io](draw.io){target="_blank"} or similar tools.
    -   Use conditional panels, modules, and well-designed layouts to create a user-friendly interface.
    -   Iterate rapidly to test how different implementations enhance UI/UX.
-   Establish a standard application/dashboard template layout such as [Shiny Dashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/){target='_blank'}, [bslib](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/){target='_blank'} and/or [bs4Dash](https://rinterface.github.io/bs4Dash/index.html){target='_blank'}.
    -   Create custom R function wrappers based on organization theme and color layout.
    -   Re-use the template for new builds and ideas to maintain consistency and coherence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Principles of Application Design

-   Define the **flow of reactivity** for the overall application/dashboard.
    -   One of my favorites is to use the **Waterfall Reactivity Model**.
    -   Helps to avoid **Reactivity Spaghetti Mess**
    -   Avoid cluttered and confusing reactivity paths.
    -   Leverage Shiny's reactivity to update UI elements dynamically based on user input. This enhances interactivity and responsiveness.
-   Provide default selections for input widgets, enabling users to explore and understand the application easily.
-   Prioritize user-friendliness; if it's not intuitive, it won't be used.
-   Incorporate "tooltips", "notifications", section write-ups and clear instructions to guide users in using the application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Organize your project structure

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

-   Maintain a clear and logical directory structure.
-   Group related files together for easy navigation.
-   Create, Adopt and Enforce a standard development template for easier developer onboarding and faster development.
-   Have a project template repository for initial cloning and usage.
-   Please refer to the right image for an illustrative R project directory structure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Streamline Workflow

-   Use RStudio Projects
    -   Isolates your development environment.
    -   Relative path referencing for your project files.
    -   Segregate development flow and context.
-   Version Control with Git
    -   Track changes, collaborate with team members, and manage project history effectively using Git.
    -   Use Issues, Pull Requests and Connected Commits for efficient and effortless parallel development.

![](data/question.png){.absolute top="3rem" right="0" height="200"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Shiny Development Tips

-   Establish and adhere to a **standard** file and code structure.
-   Implement **coding standards** to facilitate seamless collaboration between Bio Statistics teams and R developers.
-   Emphasize the use of **functions** and **shiny modules** whenever possible.
-   Optimize Server logic via **Profiling** and performance tuning
    -   Minimize unnecessary computations and avoid redundant calculations.
    -   Use tools like `profvis` to identify **performance bottlenecks** and Optimize critical sections of your code for speed.
    -   Use **benchmarking** techniques to compare computation speeds of various packages. Refer R function `rbenchmark::benchmark()`.
-   Create smaller, independent **Proof of Concepts (POCs)** for new feature requests.
    -   For example, capture simulation attributes in a table and select them for subsequent runs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Shiny Development Tips

-   Debugging like a pro
    -   Debug via `browser()`, `debug(function_name)`, and debug points.
    -   Set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables to troubleshoot efficiently.
-   Apply standard software development principles:
    -   DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
    -   YAGNI (You aren't going to need it)
    -   KISS (Keep it Simple Silly)
    -   Document your code for humans.
    -   Prioritize clean code at all times.
    -   Separation of Concerns.

![](data/logo_idea.png){.absolute bottom="50" right="0" height="200"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Facilitate Consistent Reporting

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

-   Utilize **parameterized markdown** reports for dynamic MS Word report generation within the application.
-   Adhere to the organization's document template for uniformity in reporting.
-   Ensure each page or process has a predefined standard write-up with dynamic bits/sections based on simulation calculations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ensuring Reproducibility

-   Leverage package management tools
    -   Utilize [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html){target="_blank"} or [`packrat`](https://github.com/rstudio/packrat){target="_blank"} to manage package dependencies.
    -   Provides a controlled environment for your project.
    -   Ensure reproducibility and minimize version conflicts.
-   Rely on packages published and actively maintained on **CRAN** for a validated R environment.
-   Establish unit tests for every Bio Stats function used to ensure accurate and consistent results.
-   Invest time to create an in-depth GitHub ReadMe with the sections **Project Overview**, **Getting Started**, **User Application Flow and Usage**, **Key Programming Concept Implemented** (if any) and **Developer Guide** providing comprehensive project reproducibility instructions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Enhancing Scalability

-   Implement **modularization** and **functional programming** for a **plug-and-play** development format across applications.
-   Enable multiple studies to be added concurrently using standard **git branching strategies**, involving multiple concurrent developers.
-   **Async Programming**: Evaluate longer simulations in a **separate R process** to keep the current R process running the shiny application free for use, preventing app performance issues.
    -   Few R packages to aid this are: [callr](https://github.com/r-lib/callr/){target="_blank"}, [mirai](https://github.com/shikokuchuo/mirai){target="_blank"}, [crew](https://github.com/wlandau/crew){target="_blank"}, [coro](https://github.com/r-lib/coro){target="_blank"}, [future](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future){target="_blank"} and [promises](https://github.com/rstudio/promises/){target="_blank"}
-   Take a step further and deploy simulation functions as internal APIs with **Plumber**.
-   Write your **custom JavaScript and R bindings** for implementing unique feature requests.
-   Approach feature requests as a blend of **web development**, **software engineering**, and **R development**.
